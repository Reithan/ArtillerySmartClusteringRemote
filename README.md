Settings:

- Cluster mode: Choose whether to target Spawners only or Spawners and Worms (default: Spawners only)
- Cluster radius:  Radius in tiles (default 32)
- Merge radius: The mod tries to merge targets into one flare to reduce the number of artillery shells needed. Higher number means more potential targets get merged into one flare. Numbers between 6 and 8 work well.

**Advanced Artillery Remotes Continued** adds two additional artillery remotes to the game:

-   *Artillery Cluster Remote*, which targets nearby spawners and/or worms and blankets them with artillery fire.

-   *Artillery Discovery Remote*, which lays down artillery fire in an arc, useful for exploring the map.

A number of settings are provided for controlling wheter only spawners or both spawners and worms should be targeted, as well as allowing some tweaking in terms of how large of an area should be bombarded. For more details please see the in-game setting descriptions.


# History

Original mod ([Advanced Artillery Remotes](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/AdvArtilleryRemotes)) was implemented and maintained by [Dockmeister](https://mods.factorio.com/user/Dockmeister).

When Factorio 1.1 came out, the mod stopped working, and after a period of inactivity a fork was created by [azaghal](https://mods.factorio.com/user/azaghal) under name [Advanced Artillery Remotes Continued](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/AdvArtilleryRemotes) with necessary fixes (a mere bump in Factorio version in info file was sufficient).

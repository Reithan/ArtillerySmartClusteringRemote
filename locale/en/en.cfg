[mod-setting-description]
aar-verbose=Enable verbose notifications when using advanced artillery remotes. Outputs detailed information to console.
aar-cluster-mode=Specify what entities should be targeted by artillery cluster remote.
aar-cluster-radius=Specify coverage radius (in tiles) when using artillery cluster remote. Increasing this value result in larger area being covered by the artillery strike.
aar-merge-radius=Specify overlap radius for optimising firing of artillery rounds when using artillery cluster remote. Higher values result in higher number of artillery rounds fired, lower values reduce artillery rounds usage. It is recommended to set this value to artillery ammo explosion radius (higher values could result in some targets slipping through).
aar-arc-radius=Specify discovery arc radius (in degrees) when using the artillery discovery remote. Center of arc is the artillery piece closest to requested position.
aar-angle-width=Specify distance (along the arc) between targets used with artillery discovery remote.
